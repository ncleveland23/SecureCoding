# SecureCoding
This is a collection of the work from my CS-405 Secure Coding course. 
In this course I focused on common security vulnerabilities that are found in software. I also learned techniques and strategies to develop robust and secure code, leveraging secure programming principles. I gained authentic experience identifying security vulnerabilities and writing secure code to mitigate risks to software and data.
